<h1><span class="sp1">martians never die</span></h1>

<h2>By LUCIUS DANIEL</h2>

<div class="bk1"><p><i><big><b>It was a wonderful bodyguard:
no bark, no bite, no sting ...
just conversion of the enemy!</b></big></i></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">At</span> three-fifteen, a young man
walked into the circular
brick building and took
a flattened package of cigarettes
from his shirt pocket.</p>

<p>"Mr. Stern?" he asked, throwing
away the empty package.</p>

<p>Stern looked with hard eyes at
the youthful reporter. He recognized
the type.</p>

<p>"So they're sending around
cubs now," he said.</p>

<p>"I'm no cub&mdash;I've been on the
paper a whole year," the reporter
protested, and then stopped,
realizing his annoyance had
betrayed him.</p>

<p>"Only a year. The first time
they sent their best man."</p>

<p>"This ain't the first time," said
the young man, assuming a bored
look. "It's the fourth time, and
next year I don't think anybody
will come at all. Why should
they?"</p>

<p>"Why, because they might be
able to make it," Beryl spoke up.
"Something must have happened
before."</p>

<p>Stern watched the reporter
drink in Beryl's loveliness.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Curtis," the young
man said, "everyone has it figured
out that Dr. Curtis got stuck in
the fourth dimension, or else lost,
or died, maybe. Even Einstein
can't work out the stellar currents
your husband was depending on."</p>

<p>"It's very simple," replied
Beryl, "but I can't explain it intelligibly.
I wish you could have
talked to Dr. Curtis."</p>

<p>"Why is it that we have to
come out here just once a year to
wait for him? Is that how the
fourth dimension works?"</p>

<p>"It's the only time when the
stellar currents permit the trip
back to Earth. And it's <i>not</i> the
fourth dimension! Clyde was always
irritated when anyone
would talk about his traveling to
Mars in the fourth dimension."</p>

<p>"It's interdimensional," Stern
put in.</p>

<p>"And you're his broker?" asked
the reporter, throwing his cigarette
down on the brick floor and
stepping on it. "You're his old
friend from college days, handled
his financial affairs, and helped
him raise enough money to build
his machine?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Stern replied, a little
pompously. "It was through my
efforts that several wealthy men
took an interest in the machine,
so that Dr. Curtis did not have to
bear the entire expense himself."</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah," the reporter
sighed. "I read an old story on
it before I came here. Now I'm
out of cigarettes." He looked
hopefully at Stern.</p>

<p>Stern returned the look coldly.
"There's a store where you can
buy some about three blocks
down the road."</p>

<p>"Is that the room where he's
expected to materialize with his
machine?" The reporter pointed
to an inner door.</p>

<p>"Yes. Dr. Curtis wanted to be
sure no one would be injured.
This inner circular room was
built first; then he had the outer
wall put up as an added precaution.
The circular passageway
we're in leads all around the old
room, but this doorway is the
only entrance."</p>

<p>"And what are those holes in
the top of the door for?"</p>

<p>"If he returns, we can tell by
the displaced air rushing out.
Then the door will open automatically."</p>

<p>"And when is the return scheduled
for?" asked the reporter.</p>

<p>"Three-forty-seven and twenty-nine
seconds."</p>

<p>"If it happens," the reporter
added skeptically. "And if it
doesn't, we have to wait another
year."</p>

<p>"Optimum conditions occur
just once a year."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going out to get
some cigarettes. I've got time ...
and probably nothing to wait
for. I'll return though."</p>

<p>He walked briskly through the
outer door.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"This</span> is the hardest part of
the year, especially now.
Suppose he did come back,"
Beryl said plaintively.</p>

<p>"You don't have to worry,"
Stern assured her. "Clyde himself
said that if he didn't come back
the second year, he might not
make it at all." Stern opened his
gold case now and offered Beryl
a cigarette.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "But he
made two trial runs in it first and
came back."</p>

<p>"That was for a short distance
only&mdash;that is, a short distance
astronomically. Figuring for
Mars was another story. Maybe
he missed the planet and ..."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't! It's just not <i>knowing</i>
that I can't stand."</p>

<p>"Well," he said drily, "we'll
know in&mdash;" he stopped and
looked at his wristwatch&mdash;"in
just about fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>"I can't wait," she moaned.</p>

<p>He put his arm around her.
"Relax. Take it easy and stop
worrying. It'll just be like last
time."</p>

<p>"Not the last time at all. We
hadn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As soon as we are able to
leave here," he said, drawing her
close and squeezing her gently,
"I'll take steps to have him declared
legally dead. Then we'll
get married."</p>

<p>"That's not much of a proposal,"
she smiled. "But I guess
I'll have to accept you. You have
Clyde's power of attorney."</p>

<p>"And we'll be rich. Richer than
ever. I'll be able to use some of
my own ideas about the investments.
As a matter of fact, I
have already." And he frowned
slightly.</p>

<p>"We have enough," Beryl said
quickly. "Don't try to speculate.
You know how Clyde felt about
that."</p>

<p>"But he spent so damned much
on the machine. I had to make
back those expenses somehow."</p>

<p>Steps sounded outside and they
drew apart. The reporter came in
with a companion of about his
own age.</p>

<p>"Better wipe the lipstick off,"
he grinned. "It's almost time for
something to happen."</p>

<p>Stern dabbed at his mouth angrily
with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>At first the sound was so soft
that it could hardly be heard, but
soon a whistling grew until it
became a threat to the eardrums.
The reporters looked at each
other with glad, excited eyes.</p>

<p>The whistling stopped abruptly
and, slowly, the door opened. The
reporters rushed in immediately.</p>

<p>Beryl gripped Stern's hand convulsively.
"He's come back."</p>

<p>"Yes, but that mustn't change
our plans, Beryl dear."</p>

<p>"But, Al ... Oh, why were we
so foolish?"</p>

<p>"Not foolish, dear. Not at all
foolish. Now we have to go in."</p>

<p>Inside the room was the large
sphere of metalloy. It had lost its
original gleam and was stained
and battered, standing silent,
closed, enigmatic.</p>

<p>"Where's the door?" called the
first reporter.</p>

<p>The sphere rested on a number
of metal stilts, reaching out from
the lower hemisphere, which held
it about three feet from the floor,
like a great pincushion turned
upside down.</p>

<p>Slowly, a round section of the
sphere's wall swung outward and
steps descended. As they touched
the floor, both reporters, caught
by the same idea, sprinted for it
and fought to see which would
climb it first.</p>

<p>"Wait!" shouted Stern.</p>

<p>The reporters stopped their
scuffling and followed Stern's
gaze.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Something</span> old and leathery
and horrible was emerging
from the circular doorway. Several
tentacles, like so many
snakes, slid around the hand rail
which ran down the steps. Then,
at the top, it paused.</p>

<p>Stern felt an immediate and
unreasoning hate for the thing,
whatever it was, a hate so strong
that he forgot to feel fear. It
seemed to him to combine the
repulsive qualities of a spider and
a toad. The body, fat and repugnant,
was covered by a loose
skin, dull and leathery, and the
fatness seemed to be pulled downward
below the lower tentacles
like an insect's body, until it was
wider at the bottom than at the
top.</p>

<p>Like a salt shaker, Stern
thought.</p>

<p>It turned its head&mdash;it had no
neck; the loose skin of the body
just turned with it&mdash;and looked
back inside the sphere. The head
resembled a toad's, but a long
trident tongue slid in and out
quickly, changing the resemblance
to that of a malformed
snake.</p>

<p>From the interior, Dr. Curtis
appeared beside the creature and
stood there vaguely for a moment.
Stern noticed that his clothes
seemed just as new as when he
had left, but he had grown a
long, untrimmed beard, and his
face had a vacant expression, as
if he were hypnotized.</p>

<p>The creature looked upward at
Curtis, who was head and shoulders
taller, and its resemblance
changed again in Stern's mind,
so that now it looked like a dog,
at least in attitude. From its
mouth came a low hissing noise.</p>

<div class="figr"><img src="images/001.png" width="364" height="500" alt="" title="" />
<b><small>Illustrated by WILLER</small></b></div>

<p>Curtis looked down at the dog-spider-toad,
his eyes slowly beginning
to focus. The creature
wiggled like a seal with a fish in
sight, then slid and bumped down
the steps, with Curtis following
him.</p>

<p>"Clyde!" cried Beryl and
rushed toward Curtis.</p>

<p>The outstretched tentacles of
the beast stopped her, but at a
touch from Curtis they fell away
and Beryl was in his arms.</p>

<p>Stern watched the scene sourly
and with rage in his heart. Why
hadn't Clyde waited another
year? Then nothing could have
changed things. Now he would
lose not only Beryl, but the management
of the money that was
left, and the marketing of new
patents on the machine. Curtis
did not approve of speculation,
especially when it lost money.</p>

<p>"You've changed, Clyde," Beryl
was saying as she hugged him.
"What is the matter&mdash;do you
need a doctor?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't want a doctor, but
I have to get home," said Curtis.</p>

<p>Stern felt anger again beating
in his brain like heavy surf on a
beach. Curtis was sick. The least
he could have done was die. Well,
maybe he still would. And if he
didn't he could be helped to&mdash;Stern
saw the beast looking at
him intently, malevolently. Its
face might have looked almost
human, now that it was so close,
if it had possessed eyebrows and
hair. As it was, its nose rose
abruptly and flared into two
really enormous nostrils, but its
mouth looked small and wrinkled,
like that of an old grandmother
without any teeth.</p>

<p>They turned to the doorway
without noticing the absence of
the reporters, who had long since
run off to telephone and get
photographers.</p>

<p>Curtis walked slowly. He would
stop for a moment, look about as
if expecting something entirely
different, and then he would move
forward again.</p>

<p>They all got into the car, Curtis
and Beryl on the front seat,
with Beryl driving, and Stern and
the creature in the rear. As Beryl
drove, Stern looked savagely at
the back of Curtis's head, but he
felt the beast staring at him balefully.
Could it be a mind reader?
That was ridiculous. How could
anything that couldn't speak read
a person's mind?</p>

<p>He turned to study it. The
Martian, if that was what it was,
had only six tentacles, three on
each side. The lower ones were
heavy and almost as thick as legs.
The upper ones were small and
were obviously used as hands,
while it was possible that the
middle ones could be used either
way. A series of suction cups or
sucking pads were at the end of
each tentacle. With equipment like
this, it could walk right up the
side of a building, except, perhaps,
for the higher gravity of
Earth.</p>

<p>Stern could smell it now, a dry,
desert smell, and that made it
more revolting than ever. They
were born to hate each other.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">When</span> they got home, Beryl
was all solicitousness. The
way a woman is when she has a
man to impress, Stern thought.</p>

<p>"Just sit right here in your old
chair," she told Curtis, "and I'll
call a doctor. Then I'll put some
water on to heat." But first she
knelt by his side and laid her
head on his breast. "Oh, darling,"
she said with a sob, "Why did
you wait so long? I've missed you
so."</p>

<p>A very good act, Stern told
himself bitterly, without believing
it at all.</p>

<p>She got up and turned toward
Stern. "Will you help me get
some water on, Al?" she asked.
"I'm going to phone."</p>

<p>He went into the kitchen. He
knew where the kettle was, the
refrigerator, the mixings. He
could hear her dialing, and then,
before he got the kettle on the
burner, she came inside and
closed the kitchen door.</p>

<p>"Clyde's sick and I have to
take care of him," she said
anxiously.</p>

<p>It wasn't entirely the money,
he confessed to himself now. He
hated the situation, but he had
to give in&mdash;on the surface anyway.</p>

<p>"Okay, let's forget the whole
thing," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, Al dear, I knew you'd understand!
I've got to go back now
and try the phone again. I got a
busy signal."</p>

<p>Stern followed her, still rankling
at the way Curtis had
forced Beryl to live while he spent
so generously on his own expensive
interests. Shortly after their
marriage, he had built a home
for Beryl and himself in an exclusive
suburb, on a hilly bit
of land with a deep ravine at the
back. But it was small and Beryl
had not even been allowed maids
except when they entertained,
which was seldom. Soon he would
change all that, Stern told himself.
They had not dared to while
Clyde was away.</p>

<p>In the modern living room,
Curtis sprawled in his easy chair
as though he hadn't moved since
they had placed him there. But
his air of abstraction seemed to
have increased. Before him sat
the beast, looking, Stern thought,
more like a dog than ever. Its
head wasn't cocked to one side,
but that, less than its alien appearance,
was the one thing to
spoil the illusion.</p>

<p>Tires screeched in the driveway
while Beryl was still at the telephone.
Stern went to the front
door, closed it and put the chain
bolt in place. The back door
would still be locked and they
would hardly try to force the
screen windows.</p>

<p>Heavy steps pounded up the
front walk. "Did Dr. Curtis really
get back?" The first man shot out.
The one who followed had a
camera.</p>

<p>"Dr. Curtis has returned,"
Stern spoke through the opening
of the front door which the chain
permitted, "but his physical condition
won't permit questioning,
at least until his doctor has seen
him."</p>

<p>"Did he really bring back a
Martian? We want to see the
Martian anyway."</p>

<p>"We can't have Dr. Curtis disturbed
in any way until after his
physician has examined him,"
Stern said bluntly.</p>

<p>"Is he in there?"</p>

<p>"We'll give you a report when
we're ready."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A&nbsp;second</span> car pulled up to
the house as Stern shut the
front door, and went to check the
rear one. When he came back,
flashes from the window showed
the cameraman was trying to take
pictures through the glass. Stern
drew the shades.</p>

<p>"Well, poor Schaughtowl, so
you had to come with me," Curtis
was saying to the monster.</p>

<p>The beast wiggled again as it
had on the steps of the machine.
A tail to wag wasn't really necessary,
Stern decided, when there
was so much body to wiggle.</p>

<p>Schaughtowl, as Curtis addressed
it, seemed to brighten in
the darkened room.</p>

<p>"Poor, dear Schaughtowl," said
Curtis gently.</p>

<p>It was unmistakable now&mdash;the
skin actually brightened and
emitted a sort of eerie, luminous
glow.</p>

<p>Curtis leaned over and put his
hand on what would have been
Schaughtowl's neck. The loose
skin writhed joyously, and, snakelike,
the whole body responded in
rippling waves of emotion.</p>

<p>"Gull Lup," the monster&mdash;said
wasn't the right word, but it was
not a bark, growl, mew, cheep,
squawk or snarl. Gulp was as
close as Stern could come, a dry
and almost painful gulping noise
that expressed devotion in some
totally foreign way that Stern
found revolting.</p>

<p>He realized that the phone had
been ringing for some time. He
disconnected it, and then heard
loud knocking.</p>

<p>"It's Dr. Anderson," he heard a
man's voice calling impatiently
and angrily.</p>

<p>Cautiously, Stern opened the
door, but his care was needless.
With a few testy remarks, the
doctor quickly cleared a space
about the door and entered.</p>

<p>He went at once to Curtis, with
only a single shocked glance at
Schaughtowl.</p>

<p>"Where the devil have you been
and where in hell did you get that
thing?" he asked as he unbuttoned
Curtis's coat and shirt.</p>

<p>Since playing with his pet, Curtis
seemed more awake. "I went
to Mars," he said. "They're incredibly
advanced in ways we
hardly guess. We're entirely off
the track. I just came back to
explain how."</p>

<p>"Your friend doesn't look very
intelligent," the doctor answered,
busy with his stethoscope.</p>

<p>"Animals like Schaughtowl are
used for steeds or pets," said Curtis.
"The Ladonai are pretty much
like mankind, only smaller."</p>

<p>"Why did you stay so long?"</p>

<p>"After I left, the Ladonai told
me, they were going to shut off
any possible communication with
Earth until we advance more.
They think we're at a very dangerous
animal-like stage of development.
Once I came home,
I knew I couldn't go back, so I
wanted to learn as much as I
could before I left them."</p>

<p>"Stand up for a minute," ordered
the doctor.</p>

<p>"Not right now," said Curtis.
"I'm too tired."</p>

<p>"You'd better get to bed, then."</p>

<p>"I think not. It's merely caused
by the difference in gravity and
heavier air. The Ladonai told me
to expect it, but not to lie down.
After a while I'll try to take a
short walk."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">So</span> Clyde wasn't going to die,
after all, Stern thought. He
had come home with a message,
and, remembering the determination
of the man, Stern knew he
wouldn't die until he had given it.
But he had to die. He would die,
and who was competent enough
to know that it wasn't from the
shock of having come home to
denser air and a heavier gravity?</p>

<p>There were ways&mdash;an oxygen
tube, for example. Pure oxygen
to be inhaled in his sleep by lungs
accustomed to a rarified atmosphere,
or stimulants in his food
so it would look like a little too
much exertion on a heart already
overtaxed. There were ways.</p>

<p>Stern's scalp tingled unpleasantly,
and he saw the Martian
looking at him intently, coldly.
In that moment Stern knew without
question that his mind was
being read. Not his idea, perhaps,
but his intent toward Curtis.
The Martian would have to
be attended to first.</p>

<p>"Is it true, Dr. Anderson? Will
he be all right?" Beryl was sitting
on the arm of the chair next to
Schaughtowl, and she was looking
at Clyde almost as adoringly
as the Martian. A few hours had
undone all that Stern had managed
to do in four years.</p>

<p>If Stern had been uncertain,
that alone would have decided
him.</p>

<p>"I think so," said the doctor.
"He seems to be uncomfortable,
rather than in pain. I'll send you
a prescription for his heart, if he
breathes too heavily. Be sure,
though, not to give him more
than one pill in three hours."</p>

<p>"Of course." Beryl was never
that solicitous toward Stern.</p>

<p>"And you'll be in quarantine
here until the government decides
what, if any, diseases he and the
Martian may have brought back
with them."</p>

<p>"None at all, Doctor." Curtis's
voice was markedly more slurred,
and he stared intently with unblinking
eyes at the blank wall.</p>

<p>"Well, that's something we
can't tell yet. Well have to keep
out the press and television men,
anyway, because of your health.
If I'm not detained, I'll be back
tomorrow morning. Call me if
there's any change."</p>

<p>On his way out, the physician
was besieged by reporters and
photographers, baulked of better
subjects. Shortly after the doctor's
departure, police sirens came
screaming up. The men waiting
around the house were moved
outside the gate and a guard was
set at every entrance.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Later</span>, a messenger came, was
interrogated by the police
sergeant who took a small package
from him and brought it to
the house.</p>

<p>"Medicine," the sergeant said,
handing it gingerly to Stern. "You
can't leave here without permission."
And he walked hurriedly
away.</p>

<p>This might be the answer. Stern
had a good idea of what the doctor
had prescribed&mdash;something
he'd said, for the heart. It must
have been pretty powerful, too,
for the doctor to warn against an
overdose. Two at once might do
it, or another two a little later.</p>

<p>But there was Schaughtowl.</p>

<p>"Al," said Beryl, "stay with
Clyde while I fix something for
him to eat."</p>

<p>She was more beautiful than
ever. Emotions, he thought wryly,
become a woman; they thrive on
them. In a few minutes a woman
could change like this. It was
enough to make a man lose faith
in the sex.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said easily.</p>

<p>Curtis seemed to sleep with
wide open eyes gazing blankly
at the far wall. Schaughtowl sat
motionless before him, watchful
as a dog, yet still like a snake or
spider patiently waiting. Didn't
the beast ever sleep?</p>

<p>A drink was what Stern needed.
He went to the closet and poured
a double brandy. He sipped it
slowly. As delicious fire ran down
his gullet and warmed his stomach,
he felt his tension ease and
a sense of confidence pervade his
mind.</p>

<p>He needn't worry. He was always
successful, except that once
with the stocks. And he had calm
nerves.</p>

<p>There were guards out in front
now in khaki uniform; the Governor
must have called out a
company of the National Guard.
Stern noticed some state police,
too. The house was well guarded
on the three sides surrounded by
a neat, white picket fence. In the
back, the severe drop into the ravine
made guards there unnecessary.</p>

<p>It was dark before Dr. Curtis
moved. Beryl was watching him;
she had little to say to Stern
now.</p>

<p>"How about some broth, dear?"
she asked Curtis immediately.</p>

<p>Slowly, Clyde's eyes focused on
her. He smiled. "Let's try it."</p>

<p>He let Beryl feed him, sitting
on a stool beside his chair and
being unnecessarily motherly and
coddling about it.</p>

<p>For a while after he had eaten,
Clyde sat in his chair, looking at
Beryl with his new and oddly
gentle smile. It seemed to activate
some hidden response in her,
for she glowed with tenderness.</p>

<p>"I suppose," Curtis slurred, "I
ought to try to walk now."</p>

<p>"Let me help." Stern rose and
crossed the room.</p>

<p>The Martian rustled like snakes
in the weeds, and hissed.</p>

<p>Beryl said without suspicion,
"Thank you, Al. I knew you'd do
whatever you could for Clyde."
And she rested her hand trustingly
on his arm.</p>

<p>What was past was past, not to
be wept over, not to be regretted.</p>

<p>"Like to walk out in the back
for the air?" Stern asked. "The
breeze is coming from that direction."</p>

<p>"That will do very well," said
Curtis, obviously not caring a bit.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Stern</span> helped Curtis from his
chair and supported him under
the arm. They went out the
back door, the Martian slithering
after them. It was cooler in the
garden. Stern felt a renewed surge
of self-confidence.</p>

<p>"The stars&mdash;" Curtis stopped
to look upward.</p>

<p>The night was almost cloudless
and there was no moon. The
house hid any view of the crowds
and the guards holding them
back. They were alone in the
dark.</p>

<p>Curtis started forward again,
with the Martian scraping along
behind. It would never let Curtis
out of its sight as long as it lived;
that much was clear to Stern.</p>

<p>He guided Curtis to a seat close
to the ravine, a favorite spot. Always
the Martian was a step&mdash;or
a slither&mdash;behind, and when Curtis
sat down, Schaughtowl sat between
his beloved master and the
precipitous drop.</p>

<p>Stern picked up a rock from
the rock garden and tossed it
into the ravine. The Martian did
not take his eyes off Curtis. Stern
picked up a larger rock, a sharp,
pointed one. He was behind the
Martian and Curtis was looking
away unseeingly into the night.</p>

<p>It was simple, really, and well
executed. The beast's skull bashed
in easily, being merely thin bones
for a thin atmosphere and light
gravitation. A push sent it over
the edge of the ravine.</p>

<p>Curtis sat unnoticing, and the
traffic jam out front created more
than enough confusion to drown
out any noise from the creature's
fall.</p>

<p>Stern's palm stung. He realized
that, before the Martian had
pitched over the ravine, a suction
pad had for a moment caught at
his hand. It had done the beast
no good, though.</p>

<p>Curiously, the Martian had not
guarded itself, only Curtis. Sitting
with its back to Stern had
really invited attack. The mind-reading
ability was just something
that Stern had nervously
imagined.</p>

<p>The police would not be able
to tell his rock from any other.
The heavy body, its ungainly
movement and thin bones would
explain everything. Besides, there
was no motive for killing the
Martian and what penalty could
there be? It couldn't be called
murder.</p>

<p>Stern looked at the palm of his
right hand, the one that had held
the rock. It stung a little, but in
the darkness he couldn't see it.
A stinger of some kind, like a
bee, probably. The hell with it&mdash;couldn't
be fatal or Curtis would
have warned them about it.</p>

<p>The Martian had been walking
by the ravine and had clumsily
fallen in. He would report it after
he had got Curtis back into the
house.</p>

<p>Curtis was easy to arouse and
didn't seem to miss Schaughtowl.
Stern maneuvered him to the living
room, where he sank into a
chair and fell into his mood of
abstraction.</p>

<p>Beryl must be in the kitchen
cleaning up, Stern supposed. Perhaps
he had better put some kind
of germicide on his palm, just to
ward off infection.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> looked at Curtis relaxed in
the chair. Clyde suddenly appeared
oddly boyish to him,
hardly different than he had
been in college days. For a moment
Stern felt again the adolescent
admiration and fellowship
he had felt so strongly then. Don't
be stupid, he told himself angrily.
This man had the money and
the woman that had almost belonged
to him.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Moving</span> slowly, Stern deliciously
savored the aroma of
his triumph. On the table was the
bottle. Clyde would be easy, unsuspecting,
kindly.</p>

<p>It wouldn't be safe to marry
Beryl right away, but there could
never be any suspicion.</p>

<p>No need to hurry. For a moment
he wanted to watch Curtis.
He wondered what kind of pictures
Clyde was seeing on the
blank wall. Martian landscapes?
The strange Ladonai? Too bad
he hadn't stayed on Mars. Stern
couldn't help having a friendly
feeling for his old college chum,
pity, too, for what must happen
to him soon.</p>

<p>This was no way to kill anyone!</p>

<p>He was growing old and soft!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Curtis <i>did</i> have a
noble and striking face. Funny
he had never noticed it before.
It seemed to glow with an uncanny
peace.</p>

<p>Unnoticed, the numbness crept
from Stern's palm along his right
arm, and a prickly sensation appeared
in his right leg.</p>

<p>It was funny to read a person's
thoughts like this. Love flowed
from Curtis like the warm glow
from a burning candle. A sort
of halo had formed from the light
above his head.</p>

<p>Symbolic.</p>

<p>From Curtis came wave after
wave of love. He could feel it
pulsating toward him, and he felt
his own heart turn over, answer
it. Yes, Curtis was noble.</p>

<p>Stern sank cross-legged on the
floor beside Curtis and gazed at
him. The prickly sensation had
ascended from his leg up through
his chest and to his neck. But it
didn't matter. Now, for a last
time, he could feel the spell of
that perfect friendship&mdash;before
the end.</p>

<p>What end? Why should there
be any end to this eternal moment?</p>

<p>Curtis noticed him now. Those
half-closed eyes were strangely
penetrating. They looked him
through.</p>

<p>"Well, Al," he said, "so you
killed Schaughtowl?"</p>

<p>Stern looked at the kindly, godlike
face and loved it.</p>

<p>Killed whom?</p>

<p>"Poor Al," Curtis said. He
leaned over and laid his hand on
the back of Stern's neck, fondling
it much as one would a dog.
"Poor old Al."</p>

<p>Stern's heart leaped in joy.
This was ecstasy. It must be expressed.
It demanded expression.
If he had possessed a tail, he
would have wagged it. Perhaps
there was a word for that bliss.
There was, and with immense
satisfaction he spoke it.</p>

<p>"Gull Lup," he said.</p>
